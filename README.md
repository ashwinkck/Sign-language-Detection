AI-Powered ASL Detection – Utilizes advanced machine learning models to interpret sign language accurately.
Real-Time Speech Output – Converts ASL gestures into spoken language in real-time, enhancing live communication.
Cross-Platform Accessibility – Works across devices, making the technology widely accessible.
Interactive User Interface – Users can interact easily with an intuitive and responsive interface.
Accuracy and Learning Capability – The system improves over time with continued use, ensuring more accurate translations.

Workflow:
Gesture Capture – The system captures ASL gestures through a camera in real-time.
AI Model Processing – The captured gestures are processed by a deep learning model trained to recognize ASL signs.
Sign Recognition – The AI recognizes and interprets the gestures, converting them into their respective meanings.
Speech Conversion – The recognized gestures are then translated into spoken words using speech synthesis technology.
Output Delivery – The spoken words are output in real-time, allowing for smooth and continuous communication.
